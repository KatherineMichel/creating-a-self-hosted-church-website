# About Jekyll 

Jekyll version of the self-hosted [church website](https://katherinemichel.github.io/self-hosted-church-website-jekyll) and [code](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/self-hosted-church-website-jekyll/tree/gh-pages)<br>
Compare to the original [Squarespace website](http://www.prettyprairieumc.org)

## Background

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a web development framework created at [GitHub](https://github.com), the most popular place in the world for hosting open-source code. Jekyll sites can be hosted for free at GitHub and many individuals and organizations on GitHub use it as a convenient way to introduce themselves. Jekyll is user friendly, combining powerful web development features with free, easy deployment. However, Jekyll is a static framework that does not offer all traditional web development functionality. Whether it is right for a specific project needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
