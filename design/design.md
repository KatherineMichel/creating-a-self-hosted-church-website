# Design

As I said in the introduction, I am using the design of the existing Squarespace website as inspiration, to show how with a bit of expert knowledge, a small church can host a similar site for only the cost of its domain.

The design of this self-hosted website will be made using a very popular and useful web development tool called [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is a pre-made web development library for responsive design (design that automatically changes to fit the browser size) and is used by many people around the world. For instance, Bootstrap is used by some people who created a website called [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) that offers a variety of [unstyled starter Bootstrap templates](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled), several of which I will be using to make a self-hosted website that is slightly different, but comparable to the Squarespace one. The templates I will be using for both a Jekyll version of the website and a Django version of the website will be: 

* Homepage: [Start Bootstrap 3 Col Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/3-col-portfolio)
* Homepage Detail Page: [Start Bootstrap Portfolio Item](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/portfolio-item)
* Blog Homepage: [Start Bootstrap Blog Home](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home)
* Blog Post: [Start Bootstrap Blog Post](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-post)

Screenshots of the Squarespace website, Start Bootstrap templates, self-hosted website design, and a side-by-side comparison between the Squarespace website and self-hosted website design can be found in the following sections.
