# Design

Website design is created by using HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). One design can be used for both the Jekyll and Django versions of this self-hosted website with little modification to the HTML and CSS code. 

To create the design, I will be using a very popular and useful web development tool called [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is a pre-made web development library for responsive design (design that automatically changes to fit the browser size) and is used by many people around the world. I will be using several [Unstyled Starter Bootstrap Templates](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled) from a website called [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com). The templates I will be using will be: 

* Homepage: [Start Bootstrap 3 Col Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/3-col-portfolio)
* Homepage Detail Page and About Page: [Start Bootstrap Portfolio Item](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/portfolio-item)
* Blog Homepage: [Start Bootstrap Blog Home](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home)
* Blog Post: [Start Bootstrap Blog Post](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-post)
