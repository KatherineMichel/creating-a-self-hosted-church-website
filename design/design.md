# Design

Website design is created by using [Hypertext Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) (HTML) and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) (CSS). One design can be used for both the Jekyll and Django versions of this self-hosted website with little modification to the HTML and CSS code. 

To create the design, I will be using a very popular and useful web development tool called [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is a pre-made web development library for responsive design (design that automatically adapts to fit the browser size) and is used by many people around the world. I will be using several [unstyled starter Bootstrap templates](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled) from a website called [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com). 

The templates I will be using will be: 
* Homepage: [Start Bootstrap 3 Col Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/3-col-portfolio)
* Homepage detail page and about page: [Start Bootstrap Portfolio Item](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/portfolio-item)
* Activity page: a combination of pieces from other templates
* Blog homepage: [Start Bootstrap Blog Home](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-home)
* Blog post: [Start Bootstrap Blog Post](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-post)
