# Design

As I said in the introduction, I am using the design of the existing Squarespace website as inspiration, to show how with a bit of expert knowledge, a small church can host a similar site for only the cost of its domain.

The design of this self-hosted website will be made using a very popular and useful web development tool called [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). Bootstrap is a pre-made web development library for responsive design (design that automatically changes to fit the browser size) and is used by many people around the world. For instance, Bootstrap is used by some people who created a website called [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com) that offers a variety of [unstyled starter Bootstrap templates](http://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/unstyled), several of which I will be using to make a self-hosted website that is comparable to the Squarespace one.
