# Getting Started

## About Jekyll 

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is a web development framework created at [GitHub](https://github.com), the most popular place in the world for hosting open-source code. Jekyll can be hosted for free at GitHub and many individuals and organizations on GitHub use it as a convenient way to introduce themselves to the world. Jekyll is user friendly, combining powerful web development features with free, easy deployment. However, Jekyll is a static framework that does not offer all traditional web development functionality. Whether it is right for a specific project needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
