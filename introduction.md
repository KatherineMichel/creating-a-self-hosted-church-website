# Introduction

In my GitBook [Church Website and Marketing on a Budget](http://katherinemichel.gitbooks.io/church-website-and-marketing-on-a-budget/details), I documented my experience of Project Managing a modern [new website](http://www.prettyprairieumc.org), marketing materials, and marketing plan for a small church. Anytime possible, the project utilized low-cost options and pre-existing resources. Ultimately, I chose to host the new website through [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com), at $96/year, including the cost of a custom domain. I felt that Squarespace offered the best value for money for the church's situation, including beautiful, modern templates that would ensure a unique look, and an intuitive content management system that could potentially be used by non-techies and occasional volunteers, in order to keep the content relevant. After this project was complete, Squarespace raised its price to $144/year. The church continues to pay $96/year, but could be impacted in the future. 

A more advanced, but cheaper option exists: self-hosting. In this GitBook, I will show how, with a bit of expert knowledge, a church can self-host a website comparable to the Squarespace website, but for only the cost of the custom domain (~$10). 

I will demonstrate one approach: a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com) with updates made directly through GitHub as a dashboard
