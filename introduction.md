# Introduction

In my GitBook [Church Website and Marketing on a Budget](http://katherinemichel.gitbooks.io/church-website-and-marketing-on-a-budget/details), I documented my experience of Project Managing a modern new website, marketing materials, and marketing plan for a small church. Anytime possible, the project utilized low-cost options and pre-existing resources. Ultimately, I chose to host the new website through Squarespace. I felt that Squarespace offered the best value for money for the church's situation. The beautiful, modern Squarespace templates would ensure a unique look, and the intuitive content management system could potentially be used by non-techies and occasional volunteers, in order to keep the content relevant.

In addition to hosting a site through a host such as Squarespace, a more advanced and cheaper option exists: self-hosting. Using the design of the existing Squarespace website as inspiration, in this Gitbook, I will show how, with a bit of expert knowledge, a small church can host a similar site for only the cost of its domain. 

I will demonstrate two approaches:
* A Jekyll site hosted on GitHub with updates made directly through GitHub as a dashboard
* A Django site with code stored on GitHub, but deployed via Heroku, with updates made through an Admin dashboard

Regardless of which approach is used, the church can create a GitHub organization account where the code can be looked at, learned from, and contributed to. I will discuss this further in the next section.
