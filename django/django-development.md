# Django- Development

Django version of the self-hosted [church website](https://self-hosted-church-website.herokuapp.com) and [code](https://github.com/KatherineMichel/self-hosted-church-website-django)<br>

## Code Explainer

I have used the [Heroku Django Template](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-django-template), which is deployment ready. The template can be deployed for free via [Heroku free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing). One change I have made for deployment, is to add python-decouple to the requirements.txt before installation, update the settings.py and move the SECRET_KEY to the .env file, which is included in the .gitignore so it will not be committed to source control. The SECRET_KEY is sensitive information and should not be made public in production. I have also used a [GitHub Python .gitignore template](https://github.com/github/gitignore).

Most pages are static and are rendered from self_hosted_church_website_django/urls.py as a TemplateView and the domain name will prepend the URL. The Blog pages are the exception. A special app called "blog" has been created. An entry in self_hosted_church_website_django/urls.py points to blog/urls.py, which contains the Blog URLs. Because these URLs are at the app level, the Blog URL will be www.domain-name/blog and the post pages will be prepended with www.domain-name/blog. blog/models.py contains a blog post model and blog/views.py contains a view for the Blog page and post pages. The Blog page template contains a for loop that will fetch each post and insert the post info into the template. This loop will continue until every post is displayed, to form a list. The post-detail template does not need a for loop because only one post will be displayed, with the applicable info again inserted into the template. pk model variable and regular expression URLs will be used to enable abstract code to fetch blog posts created in the future. 

The project-level settings have been altered to look for static files and templates outside of the app folder. Therefore, all static files and templates are in root folders. All templates extend from base.html template. Soft-coded links to individual static files can found in the templates. URL hyperlinks are based on the "name" variable in self_hosted_church_website_django/urls.py and blog/urls.py.
