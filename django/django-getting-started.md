# Django- Getting Started

## About Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) is a fully-featured web development framework based on the [Python](https://www.python.org) programming language. Django can be used to create a website as simple as a static, persona blog, and as complex as a dynamic, high-traffic web property. 

## Django Pros and Cons

Pros:
* Sophisticated functionality out of the box
* Optional admin dashboard
* Staged deployment
* Extensive documentation and code-bases

Cons:
* More difficult to understand than Jekyll
* Cannot be rendered via GitHub (though code can be stored there)
* More difficult to deploy than Jekyll
* May not be free to deploy (depends on host and resource use)

## Cost Comparison

Squarespace website:
* $144/year basic, custom domain included
* Cost of labor, if any

Django website:
* Can be deployed for free via [Heroku free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing)
* Cost of domain (~$10)
* Cost of labor, if any
