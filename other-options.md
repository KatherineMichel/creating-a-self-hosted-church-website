# Other Options

With little modification, the same design could be used with other free or low-cost "back-end" approaches, such as:

* A [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) site hosted for free on [GitHub](https://github.com) with updates made directly through a CMS or through GitHub as a dashboard. See also [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com) website for ideas
* A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), or [PHP/WordPress](http://php.net) site deployed for free via [Heroku free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing), or [Amazon Web Services (AWS) free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) (lasts for one year), with updates made through an admin dashboard
* A [Digital Ocean $5/month app](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing), perhaps using a [one-click install](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps)
