* A [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com), or [PHP/WordPress](http://php.net) site deployed for free via [Heroku free tier](https://www.heroku.com/pricing), or [Amazon Web Services (AWS) free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free) (lasts for one year), with updates made through an admin dashboard
